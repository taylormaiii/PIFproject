# Analytics Event Contract (v2)

This document is the source of truth for analytics taxonomy, trigger points, payload properties, buckets, and dedupe rules.

## Contract rules

- Event names are stable, snake_case, and versioned by this document.
- Event-specific properties use snake_case names.
- Properties are flat key-value pairs only (no nested objects, no arrays).
- Property value types are limited to `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.
- Lifecycle transition properties use paired `previous_*` and `new_*` names for the transitioned dimension.
- Source attribution uses bounded `source_surface` and `trigger_method` values.
- All count or time dimensions use the bucket labels in this document.
- Events dispatch only when analytics consent is granted.

## Canonical events

| Event | Trigger point | Emits when | Does not emit when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `landing_viewed` | Client runtime observer mounted from `src/app/layout.tsx` | Active playthrough is available after store load, once per playthrough per tab session | Store is still loading, no active playthrough, or same session already emitted |
| `playthrough_selector_opened` | `PlaythroughSelector` header control | User opens the playthrough selector popover | Store is still loading or no active playthrough is available |
| `create_playthrough_modal_opened` | Create action inside `PlaythroughSelector` | User opens the create playthrough modal | No active playthrough is available |
| `first_encounter_saved` | Encounter mutation paths in `src/stores/playthroughs/encounters/crud.ts` and `src/stores/playthroughs/encounters/fusion.ts` | Encounter count changes from zero to at least one | Encounter count was already non-zero or mutation removes data |
| `playthrough_created` | `createPlaythrough` in `src/stores/playthroughs/store.ts` | A new playthrough is successfully appended to store state | Creation short-circuits or throws before append |
| `playthrough_switched` | `setActivePlaythrough` in `src/stores/playthroughs/store.ts` | Active playthrough changes from one existing id to a different loaded/importable id | Requested playthrough cannot be found/loaded, no previous active playthrough exists, or requested id is already active |
| `game_mode_changed` | Game mode mutation helpers in `src/stores/playthroughs/store.ts` | Active playthrough mode changes to a different mode | No active playthrough exists or requested mode matches current mode |
| `playthrough_imported` | Import success path in `src/hooks/usePlaythroughImportExport.ts` | Import file parse, store import, and active playthrough lookup complete successfully | Import fails before active imported playthrough state is available |
| `playthrough_import_failed` | Import failure paths in `src/hooks/usePlaythroughImportExport.ts` | Import attempt fails at file selection, file read, JSON parse, schema validation, store import, or unknown stage | Import completes successfully |
| `run_checkpoint_reached` | Encounter mutation paths in `src/stores/playthroughs/encounters/*.ts` | Encounter count crosses any configured checkpoint threshold | Encounter count changes without crossing a new threshold |
| `playthrough_resumed` | Client runtime observer mounted from `src/app/layout.tsx` | Active playthrough is available after store load and qualifies as a resume | Store is still loading, no active playthrough, or same session already emitted |
| `fusion_created` | Fusion transition helper called from `fusion.ts`, `crud.ts`, and `dragDrop.ts` encounter paths | Encounter transitions from not-fully-fused to fully-fused (`head` and `body` both set with fusion active) | Encounter remains non-fusion, remains partial, or is already fully fused |
| `fusion_flipped` | `flipEncounterFusion` in `src/stores/playthroughs/encounters/fusion.ts` | A flip operation succeeds on an existing fusion encounter | Encounter is missing, not fusion, or mutation does not run |
| `encounter_marked_deceased` | `markEncounterAsDeceased` in `src/stores/playthroughs/encounters/status.ts` | Encounter transitions into deceased state for this location | Operation is a no-op or status was already deceased for the encounter |
| `playthrough_exported` | Export success path in `src/hooks/usePlaythroughImportExport.ts` | Export payload serialization and download setup succeed | Export flow throws before blob URL + download setup completes |
| `github_cta_viewed` | `GitHubEngagementCta` in the fixed top bar | At least 50% of the CTA is visible | CTA is below the visibility threshold or the component already emitted for its mount |

## Dedupe policy

| Event | Dedupe strategy |
| --- | --- |
| `landing_viewed` | Session dedupe per playthrough using session storage (once per tab session) |
| `playthrough_selector_opened` | No storage dedupe required; emit each successful open intent |
| `create_playthrough_modal_opened` | No storage dedupe required; emit each successful modal open intent |
| `first_encounter_saved` | Transition dedupe only; emit when encounter count crosses from zero to one or more |
| `playthrough_created` | No storage dedupe required; emit once per successful `createPlaythrough` call |
| `playthrough_switched` | Transition dedupe only; emit once per successful active-id transition |
| `game_mode_changed` | Transition dedupe only; emit once per successful mode transition |
| `playthrough_imported` | No storage dedupe required; emit once per successful import completion |
| `playthrough_import_failed` | No storage dedupe required; emit once per failed import attempt |
| `run_checkpoint_reached` | Monotonic threshold dedupe per playthrough using persistent local storage keyed by playthrough id |
| `playthrough_resumed` | Session dedupe per playthrough using session storage (once per tab session) |
| `fusion_created` | Transition dedupe only; emit on state transition into complete fusion, never on steady state |
| `fusion_flipped` | No dedupe required beyond successful operation gating |
| `encounter_marked_deceased` | Transition dedupe only; emit only when status changes into deceased state |
| `playthrough_exported` | No storage dedupe required; emit once per successful export action |
| `github_cta_viewed` | Component-instance dedupe; emit once after 50% visibility for each CTA mount |

## Implementation notes

- Trigger detection belongs at action/mutation boundaries for mutation-backed events (for example `first_encounter_saved`), while pure UI-intent events such as `playthrough_selector_opened` and `create_playthrough_modal_opened` may emit from their presentational component.
- Event payload builders should read canonical store state after mutation when the event requires after-state fields.
- Any contract change in event names, property names, bucket labels, or thresholds must update this document first.
- `github_cta_viewed` measures visibility only. The embedded GitHub buttons render cross-origin iframes, so their clicks and completed stars are not attributable by this event.
