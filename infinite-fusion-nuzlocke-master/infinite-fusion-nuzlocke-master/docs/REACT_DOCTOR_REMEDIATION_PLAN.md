# React Doctor Remediation Plan

## Goal

Resolve confirmed React Doctor runtime-quality findings without duplicating the structural quality work owned by Fallow. Keep the changed-code gate enabled while the existing baseline is triaged in focused, behavior-preserving slices.

The initial full scan reported 267 diagnostics across 77 files: 12 errors and 255 warnings. The enforced React Doctor scope intentionally excludes maintainability, dead-code, supply-chain, and design checks; it reports 119 diagnostics across 54 files: 12 errors and 107 warnings. The observed health score was 41/100. The score is advisory because it is calculated by React Doctor's hosted service and can change independently of the local scanner.

## Ownership Boundary

| Area | Owner | React Doctor treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependency hygiene, dead code, cycles, boundaries, duplication, complexity | Fallow | Disabled or excluded |
| Runtime bugs, React Compiler blockers, application performance | React Doctor | Enforced for new error-level findings |
| Accessibility | React Doctor | Enforced for new error-level findings |
| Application security | React Doctor | Enforced for new error-level findings |
| UI design heuristics | Impeccable and manual review | Excluded |

## Working Rules

- Treat every diagnostic as a hypothesis until the affected code is understood.
- Fix the underlying behavior before adding a suppression.
- Add a narrow, documented suppression only for a confirmed false positive or intentional tradeoff.
- Keep unrelated runtime, accessibility, and component refactors in separate changes.
- Add focused coverage before changing state transitions, API behavior, or interactive UI flows.
- Do not raise the gate from error to warning until the existing baseline has an explicit disposition.

## Phase 1: Error-Level Triage

Purpose: resolve or classify every blocking diagnostic before broad warning cleanup.

- [x] Remove the GET handler's in-flight response cache in `src/app/api/sprite/variants/route.ts`. It shared a consumable `NextResponse` between concurrent requests and did not globally bound CDN probe work; HTTP and client caching remain in place.
- [x] Resolve ref-access-during-render compiler blockers. `useLocalStorage` now initializes without reading a ref during render; Floating UI commit-time ref callbacks in `ContextMenu`, `CursorTooltip`, and `PokemonEvolutionButton` have narrow documented exceptions.
- [x] Remove compiler-blocking manual memoization from `DraggableComboboxSprite`, `PokemonPCSheet`, and `TeamSlots`; each value is now a direct derivation from its canonical inputs.
- [x] Retain the existing compiler opt-outs for TanStack Table and Virtual, adding narrow documented incompatible-library exceptions at their boundaries.
- [x] Move the file-change cleanup handler out of `usePlaythroughImportExport` so its `try`/`finally` is not lowered by React Compiler.
- [x] Harden package installation with a one-day minimum release age and a no-downgrade trust policy.
- [x] Scope Vercel preview credentials to the validation, pull, build, and deploy steps so dependency installation runs without secrets. Build steps still receive credentials because the Vercel CLI requires them.
- [x] Remove `ContextMenu`'s unused open-state callback, which only caused a parent update after every local state transition (including mount).
- [x] Guard `PokemonGridItem`'s asynchronous Pokémon lookup so stale requests cannot overwrite a newer item's type data.
- [x] Complete the LocationTable virtualization audit: track replaceable table refs in effect dependencies and retain its convergent measurement pass behind a documented narrow suppression.
- [x] Derive each LocationTable row's effective fusion ID during render so its animation effect depends only on the transition value it observes.
- [x] Remove `useLocalStorage`'s routine manual memoization so its validated snapshot parsing and setter derive directly from canonical hook inputs.
- [x] Derive TeamSlots' animation inputs from canonical team data inside its effect so unrelated renders do not continually reschedule its animation frame.

Acceptance criteria:

- Every current error is fixed, deliberately suppressed with evidence, or tracked as a product or architecture decision.
- A changed-code scan against `master` reports no new errors.
- Affected state, API, and interaction paths retain focused regression coverage.

## Phase 2: Safe Accessibility And Correctness Cleanup

Purpose: reduce high-volume, low-risk warnings that have direct semantic fixes.

- [ ] Add explicit button types for the 32 `button-has-type` findings.
- [ ] Fix the three nested interactive-control findings without changing keyboard or pointer behavior.
- [ ] Add accessible labels to controls missing an associated label or relying only on placeholder text.
- [ ] Review unversioned localStorage keys and add migration-safe versioning only where stored values have a defined evolution path.

Acceptance criteria:

- Button and control changes have relevant interaction or accessibility coverage.
- No control loses an accessible name, keyboard path, or form behavior.

## Phase 3: Valtio Callback Audit

Purpose: determine whether snapshot reads in callbacks are stale-state risks before changing state access patterns.

- [x] Audit all `valtio-no-snapshot-in-callback` findings individually or by shared callback pattern.
- [x] Fix `src/components/LocationTable/FusionToggleButton.tsx`: its drop handlers now capture current drag state at event time and preserve the source across the asynchronous fusion operation; its render snapshot remains limited to the drop affordance.
- [x] Fix `src/components/PokemonCombobox/useComboboxDragAndDrop.ts`: capture a drop's drag value before async lookup, check current drag data before publishing previews, and preserve the name that scheduled each preview lookup.
- [x] Fix the remaining callbacks in `src/components/PokemonCombobox/DraggableComboboxSprite.tsx` and `src/stores/playthroughs/hooks.ts` to read the current proxy state when authorizing a drag or deciding whether to load playthroughs.
- [x] For each finding, decide whether the callback needs render-time snapshot data or current store state; the audit and fixes above retain snapshots only for render-derived values and effect subscriptions.
- [x] Add regression coverage for callbacks whose state source changes, including drag cleanup during asynchronous lookups and preserving a dropped Pokemon's source through asynchronous fusion.

Acceptance criteria:

- No callback fix changes a state transition without direct behavioral coverage.
- All callback snapshot findings are resolved; render-time snapshots remain only for render-derived values and effect subscriptions.

## Phase 4: Targeted Performance Cleanup

Purpose: address concrete runtime costs without speculative micro-optimization.

- [x] Review chained array iterations and array lookups in loops; consolidate only on verified hot paths or where the simpler implementation is equally clear.
- [x] Consolidate ordered collection transforms and repeated membership lookups in API routes, loaders, stores, and search helpers while preserving output order and identity.
- [x] Replace `transition: all` declarations with the specific animated properties.
- [x] Review await-in-loop findings for required ordering before introducing concurrency; retain sequential loader and team-death updates because their data-source and mutation semantics require ordering.
- [x] Replace JSON parse/stringify cloning only when the data shape, supported values, and copy semantics are known.
- [x] Address set-state-in-effect findings after confirming their behavior; the remaining mount and analytics updates are browser-only synchronization, not derived state.

Remaining warnings require stronger evidence before a behavior change:

- The three loader and team-action `await` loops need a representative cold-load latency trace before changing ordering or request concurrency.
- The analytics debug counter refresh needs a source-level subscription before its immediate external-state refresh can be removed.
- The logo precision warning needs an asset-size budget or visual comparison before altering its path data.

Acceptance criteria:

- Performance changes preserve ordering, cancellation, and rendering semantics.
- Benchmarks or targeted tests support changes on identified hot paths.

## Phase 5: Fallow-Owned Maintainability Backlog

Purpose: retain React Doctor's maintainability observations as optional context without creating a competing gate.

- [x] Remove React Compiler-redundant manual memoization across the app; the full scan no longer reports `react-compiler-no-manual-memoization` findings.
- [ ] Use Fallow findings and existing architecture plans to prioritize large components and manual memoization patterns.
- [ ] Consider `src/components/LocationTable/EncounterCell.tsx`, `src/components/PokemonSummaryCard/LocationSelector.tsx`, and `src/components/PokemonCombobox/useComboboxDragAndDrop.ts` only within a focused Fallow-led refactor.
- [ ] Do not change runtime code solely to improve the React Doctor score.

Acceptance criteria:

- Fallow remains the sole structural and maintainability quality gate.
- React Doctor's excluded categories remain advisory context only.

## Validation

Run the smallest relevant tests for each slice, then run:

```bash
pnpm type-check
pnpm test:run
pnpm validate
pnpm quality:graph
pnpm quality:react
```

Use a full advisory scan to measure baseline progress without changing the enforcement scope:

```bash
pnpm exec react-doctor . --yes --no-score --blocking none
pnpm exec react-doctor --score --yes
```
