# Team Member Selection Architecture

## Critical invariants

- UI selection slots (used for choosing Pokemon) are presentation constructs and not storage-field guarantees.
- Pokemon updates by identity must not assume storage field (`head`/`body`) from UI slot.
- Encounter structure changes and Pokemon field updates are separate operations.

## Implementation implications

- Use identity-based update paths for Pokemon edits (nickname, status, metadata).
- Use field-based encounter updates only when intentionally mutating encounter structure.
- Keep selection UI state decoupled from persistence-layer addressing.

## Common mistakes

- Mapping a selected UI slot directly to `updatePokemonInEncounter(..., 'head'|'body', ...)`.
- Mutating encounter field layout when the intended action is Pokemon attribute edit.
- Building feature logic that treats visual slot order as canonical storage order.
