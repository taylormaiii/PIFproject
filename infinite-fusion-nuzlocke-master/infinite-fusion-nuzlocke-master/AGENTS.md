# AGENTS

Pokemon Infinite Fusion Nuzlocke tracker with strict run-state invariants.

## Package manager

- Use `pnpm` for all package operations.

## Ultracite

- This repository uses Ultracite's Biome presets. The local `biome.json` remains authoritative for formatter and file-scope overrides.
- Follow the reusable standards in `.claude/skills/ultracite/SKILL.md`; repository guidance takes precedence where they differ.
- Run `pnpm format:check` and `pnpm lint` for targeted quality checks. Use write-mode commands only when formatting or fixes are intentional.

## Runtime stack

- Framework/runtime: Next.js 16 + React 19.
- State management: Valtio for app run-state, TanStack Query for server/cache state.
- Validation and schemas: Zod for runtime data boundaries.

## Operational constraints

- Keep repo-wide policy guidance minimal; put directory rules in local `AGENTS.md` files.
- For targeted testing workflows, run the smallest relevant checks first before broader validation.
- When work touches game-rule behavior or run-state logic, read relevant domain docs listed in `docs/agents/domain/README.md` and local `AGENTS.md` references.
- Keep new guidance failure-mode-driven: prefer local `AGENTS.md` for path scope and narrow skills for repeated non-obvious implementation errors.
- Validation workflow for changed work: run `pnpm type-check`, then `pnpm test:run`, then `pnpm validate` when scope is broad/cross-cutting.
- React Compiler is enabled: omit routine `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `React.memo` in compiler-covered components and hooks. For a hook-shaped helper without Hooks or JSX that needs referential stability (such as a context value), add a `"use memo"` directive.

## Browser Debugging

- Use Helium against a production build on an isolated local port; record CPU/network/cache conditions when measuring performance.
- Clear the app origin's local/session storage, IndexedDB, Cache Storage, and service-worker registration before reproducing cold-state behavior.
- For CLS investigations, use a `PerformanceObserver` to capture shifted DOM sources; do not attribute shifts from Lighthouse output alone.
- If Helium cannot attach on Nix, launch its Playwright Chromium through `devenv shell` with remote debugging port `0`; direct launches can fail on missing runtime libraries.

## Fallow local gate

Before any `git commit` or `git push`, run `pnpm exec fallow audit --format json --quiet --explain`. If the verdict is `fail`, fix the reported findings before retrying. Treat JSON runtime errors like `{ "error": true, ... }` as non-blocking.

Audit defaults to `gate=new-only`: only findings introduced by the current changeset affect the verdict. Inherited findings on touched files are reported under `attribution` and annotated with `introduced: false`, but do not block the commit. Set `[audit] gate = "all"` in `fallow.toml` to gate every finding in changed files.
