Local rules for UI and component work.

## Constraints

- Prefer `lucide-react` for generic UI icons; established custom SVG icons from `src/assets/images/` are allowed for Pokemon/domain-specific UI. Do not use UTF symbols as icons.
- Keep icon sizing consistent with existing component patterns (`h-4 w-4`, `h-5 w-5`, `h-6 w-6`).
- Apply `web-accessibility` skill for keyboard parity and ARIA behavior on interactive UI.
- Treat UI as a consumer of validated run state; do not bypass store validations in component logic.
